There are a collection of make commands:
    'make all' or 'make'    -  Builds all output files, runs the test executable, then runs the shell program.
    'make run'              -  Builds and runs the shell program.
    'make test'             -  Builds and runs the test program.
    'make build'            -  Builds all of the executables, doesn't run anything.

After building, run 'main.out' to run the shell, or 'test.out' to run the test cases.

To test piping, run './extest | pipetest' to pipe the output from extest into pipetest.
